    <div class="text">Many, many plants can be grown in a farm or garden setting. The world's food supply, however, relies on only about 150 species of plants. Of those 150, only 12 species make up 75% of the food people eat! Even more specifically, half of the food in the world comes from three major crops: corn, wheat, and rice.<br /><br />Outside of big agriculture, the most common plants in gardens include tomatoes, bell peppers, leafy greans, and beans. These are fairly low-maintenance, easy to grow, and a great way to save money and relieve stress.</div>
