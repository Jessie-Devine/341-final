    <div class="text">The temperate biome is characterized by short growing seasons and long, cold winters. This means that whatever plants grow here have to be able to survive the harsh conditions! Plants common in this area include various pine species and some deciduous trees (that lose their leaves in the fall) as well.<br /><br />Another organism common in the temperate region is the lichen. Lichens look a bit like plants and they are photosynthetic, but they're actually a symbiotic relationship between two organisms: fungi and algae. Typically lichen grow on surfaces like rocks or tree bark.</div>
