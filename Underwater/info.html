    <div class="text">Underwater plants are crucial to ecosystems below the surface. They provide oxygen in the water, and their decomposition also creates a nutrient-rich environment for other organisms.<br /> <br /> Did you know? Many underwater "plants" are actually not plants at all! For example, algae, which seems like a plant, is indeed a photosynthetic organism, but it doesn't possess the organized structure (such as stems, roots, or leaves) of a true plant. Even the leafy-looking giant kelp forests are actually comprised of algae.</div>
