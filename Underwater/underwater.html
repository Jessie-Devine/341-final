    <p>Many plants live here, and in other underwater habitats like swamps, rivers, lakes, and ponds as well. Aquatic plants are vital for the survival of all underwater ecosystems.</p>

    <p>Navigate to the info page to learn about the plant life in this habitat, or head over to the gallery to view some pictures.</p>
