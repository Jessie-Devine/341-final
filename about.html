    <div class="about"> The kingdom Plantae consists of approximately 400,000 species. Of these species, perhaps the most famous are the angiosperms, or flowering plants. ðŸŒ¸ Surprisingly, although flowering plants are well-known and easily the most diverse category of plant species, they only evolved approximately 135 million years ago. To put this in perspective, land plants altogether evolved about 700 million years ago!

    Plants are typically multicellular and photosynthetic, which means they create their own food. In order to do that, their cells contain chloroplasts. A chloroplast is an organelle which uses water, sunlight, and oxygen to create sugar for the plant to use. They contain chlorophyll, which is why plants are green. Poke around the site to learn more about plants in their habitats!
