    <div class="text">The plants that live in the rainforest are very diverse! They are vital for the health of the Earth and for the health of people. Many medicines humans use today have origins in the rainforest, as well as other products. The rainforest is a lush, beautiful place home to thousands of species that live no where else on the planet.<br /><br />Today, many plants (and animals) face endangerment because of habitat loss in the rainforest. It is important to conserve these places. The continuance of life on Earth depends on it.</div>
